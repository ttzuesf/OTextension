Obvious Transfer
=================
Obvious transfer protocols (OT) is a building block of cryptography protocols.
It constructs two-parties secure computation protocols.
This package implements basic obvious transfer protocols, which contains:

- Simple OT is based on Discrete Logarithm assumption (DL);
- IKNP OT is a basic OT, which can be extent to LNP assumption;

The Obvious Transfer protocol is implemented on the crypto library of golang.
